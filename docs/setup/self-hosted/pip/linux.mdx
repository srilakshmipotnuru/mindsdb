## Before You Start

There are some points that you should consider before jumping into the
installation. Please have a look at them below.

### Pip and Python Versions

We suggest using **Python 3.8.x, or 3.9.x versions** for now.

To successfully install MindsDB, use **Python 64-bit version**. Also, make sure
that **Python >= 3.8** and **pip >= 20.3**. You can check the pip and python
versions by running the `pip --version` and
`python --version` commands.

Please note that depending on your environment and installed pip and python
packages, you might have to use **pip3** instead of **pip** or **python3.x**
instead of **py**. For example, `pip3 install mindsdb` instead of
`pip install mindsdb`.

### How to Avoid Dependency Issues

Install MindsDB in a virtual environment using **pip** to avoid dependency
issues.

Or you could try to install MindsDB with
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and run the
installation from the **Anaconda prompt**.

### How to Avoid Common Errors

MindsDB requires around 3 GB of free disk space to install all of its
dependencies. Make sure to allocate min. 3 GB of disk space to avoid the
`IOError: [Errno 28] No space left on device while installing MindsDB` error.

Before anything, activate your virtual environment where your MindsDB is
installed. It is to avoid the `No module named mindsdb` error.

### How to Overcome `ImportError: failed to find libmagic`

If you get the `ImportError: failed to find libmagic` error, you should install the `libmagic` manually by running the command below:

```bash
pip install python-magic-bin
```

## Using the Python [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) Module

1. Create a new virtual environment called `mindsdb`:

   ```bash
   python -m venv mindsdb
   ```

   Now, activate it:

   ```bash
   source mindsdb/bin/activate
   ```

2. Once inside the virtual environment, run the command below to mitigate the
   dependency issues:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   ```

3. Install MindsDB:

   ```bash
   pip install mindsdb
   ```

4. Verify MindsDB installation:

   ```bash
   pip freeze
   ```

   You should see a list of installed packages including but not limited to the
   following:

   ```bash
   ...
   alembic==1.7.7
   aniso8601==9.0.1
   appdirs==1.4.4
   lightgbm==3.3.0
   lightwood==22.4.1.0
   MindsDB==22.4.5.0
   mindsdb-datasources==1.8.2
   mindsdb-sql==0.3.3
   mindsdb-streams==0.0.5
   ...
   ```

5. Start MindsDB:

   ```bash
   python -m mindsdb
   ```
   
By default, MindsDB will always start the `http` and `mysql` APIs. If you want to use Mongo API, you will need to provide that as a parameter to `--api`. You can do it as following:

   ```bash
   python -m mindsdb --api=http,mongodb,mysql
   ```

## Using Anaconda

Here, you need either [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
or [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) installed on
your machine.

1. Open Anaconda prompt and create a new virtual environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -n mindsdb
   ```

   Now, activate it:

   ```bash
   conda activate mindsdb
   ```

2. Once inside the virtual environment, run the command below to mitigate the
   dependency issues:

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   ```

3. Install MindsDB:

   ```bash
   pip install mindsdb
   ```

4. Verify MindsDB installation:

   ```bach
   conda list
   ```

   You should see a list of installed packages including but not limited to the
   following:

   ```bash
   ...
   alembic==1.7.7
   aniso8601==9.0.1
   appdirs==1.4.4
   lightgbm==3.3.0
   lightwood==22.4.1.0
   MindsDB==22.4.5.0
   mindsdb-datasources==1.8.2
   mindsdb-sql==0.3.3
   mindsdb-streams==0.0.5
   ...
   ```

## Further Issues?

You can try to replicate your issue using the
[Docker setup](/setup/self-hosted/docker/).

Also, please create an issue with detailed description in the
[MindsDB GitHub repository](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/issues) so we can
help you. Usually, we review issues and respond within a few hours.

## What's Next

Now that you installed and started MindsDB locally in your Docker container, go ahead and find out how to create and train a model using the [`CREATE MODEL`](/sql/create/model) statement. In the **MindsDB SQL** section, you'll find a comprehensive overview of the SQL syntax offered by MindsDB. We also provide No-SQL syntax documented in the **MindsDB No-SQL** section.

You can connect MindsDB to different clients, including [PostgreSQL CLI](/connect/postgres-client) and [MySQL CLI](/connect/mysql-client).

Check out the **Use Cases** section to follow tutorials that cover Large Language Models, Natural Language Processing, Time Series, Classification, and Regression models.
